### Background:
Many people's ignorance about the nutritional content of the fruits and vegetables they consume. so we want to Increase public interest in a healthy lifestyle and consumption of nutritious food. this is necessary because there is an opportunity to dominate the AI-based identification application market before competitors emerge.
### Business Problems/Opportunities:
There is a lack of nutritional information that is easily accessible to the public and we want to increase user loyalty with additional educational features.
### Why FruLens?
Fruits are packed with essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants that support overall health and help prevent chronic diseases. By using FruLens, users can:
- Analyze the nutritional content of fruits via image recognition.
- Learn about the health benefits of different fruits.
- Make informed dietary choices to improve long-term well-being.
