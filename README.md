# FruLens: Fruit Nutritional Analysis Application

## Group ID: C242-PS525

Welcome to the FruLens project repository! This application focuses on providing nutritional analysis of various fruits, making it easier for users to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Below, you'll find detailed information about our team and the scope of the project.

## Project Overview
Maintaining optimal body health requires a balanced approach that includes both proper nutrition and physical activity. However, busy lifestyles often push people towards quick, less healthy food options, resulting in lower fruit consumption. Factors such as cost, availability, and lack of awareness about the health benefits of fruits also contribute to this issue.

### Why FruLens?
Fruits are packed with essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants that support overall health and help prevent chronic diseases. By using FruLens, users can:
- Analyze the nutritional content of fruits via image recognition.
- Learn about the health benefits of different fruits.
- Make informed dietary choices to improve long-term well-being.

### Project Scope
- **Platform**: Android (Application only available for Android devices).
- **Tools/IDE**:
  - Android Studio
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Google Colab
  - VS Code
- **Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Platforms**:
  - Figma
  - Google Cloud
  - Postman
- **API**: REST API
- **Dataset Resource**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)

### Challenges and Solutions
One challenge is the variability in image quality due to differences in camera resolution, lighting, and focus. To address this, the FruLens application will provide guidance to users on taking better pictures, such as:
- Ensuring sufficient lighting.
- Focusing the camera properly on the fruit.
